# Customer Churn
Performing PCA to reduce components and applying different classification techniques.

**What is done in the project?**
* Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)
* Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).
* Derive new features.
* Reduce the number of variables using PCA.
* Train a ***Random Forest, Logistic Regression and XGBOOST*** models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).
* Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that is is more important to identify churners than the non-churners accurately - choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.
* Finally, choose a model based on some evaluation metric.
